## Setup

1. **Buy a domain**

Before diving into the capabilities of the Aikido Zen Firewall to protect a legacy application or API, we first need to build some core elements like purchasing a domain name. This will be useful for other labs and howtos and we highly recommend that everyone learn cybersecurity by doing cybersecurity.

2. **Create an Azure Subscription**

You’ll need access to an Azure Cloud account. If you don’t already have one, Microsoft offers a free subscription that provides a limited set of services and credits to get started. Setting up the free subscription only takes a few minutes and ensures you’ll be able to complete the steps in this guide without incurring unexpected costs.
